* Write simple test that navigates to http://juliemr.github.io/protractor-demo/ and checks its title
* Sum up some two values and wait for the result
    * Use Thread.sleep() to wait for element to load (but use it only ofr this zHomework, since "Waiting" topic will be discussed in upcoming sessions)
* Do multiple mathematical actions and count the number of actions


1. Think about - how to make the tests Small, Atomic (One test - one clear goal, TC should verify only one functionality) and Autonomous. In order to do that, examine
 * how many features are tested
 * can or should those features be divided into separate test
2. Try to use CSS Selectors instead of XPath
